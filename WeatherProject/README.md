# Weather project

here first time get information absed on some Weather forcest

in this project there was alot to learn from fetching some api and turning data we get into some visible ui.

we learned how to convert timeunix into an day ,date

we learn how to checked if the data we get is in array or array of objects and turn into an array of arrays

we learn how to match some fetched data and match it into some of our data to match for example (weather codes ) we fetched weather codes from api and mathc if the weather codes is same we create data weather codes

we use some react hooks (useState and ,useEffect ) for rendering the api calls

also reponsiveness not yet fully finished , i just finish on how the challange are needed to be made thats why some process is cant be used , but in the future i will finish this
